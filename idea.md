I have taken inspiration from edex.ui. Instead of a local file explorer, the file explorer can display files and data contained in the database. Please guide the team in connecting the Front end plan to the back end. 
Since the website is meant to be a free open source resource, I feel as if the edex.ui repository is the best supportive of the experience intended when using the application, futuristic and user friendly. 
The edex.ui repository utilizes node.js as well as a simple javascript based front end already. I imagine a multi-pane user interface with the following features. 

Each feature section is highlighted in the color #ff37d9 . There are 12 panes in total. The lettered numbers are a recognition of multiple features contained within of a single pane. 
Features:
- 1. Current time 
- 2. Project Metadata
- 3. Doccument Correlation Strength
- 4. Time series heatmap of event dates relevant to node
- 5. Node key role players list and involvement
- 6a. File Explorer
- 6b. On mobile this toggles between file explorer and terminal
- 7. Document Selection Tabs
- 8a. Document (node)Location of origin
- 8b. Document (node)Primary Location of Impact 
- 9. Leaflet.Js Map of Locality and relevant documents to node
- 10. Knowledge graph highlight of connected documents to node 
- 11.Document viewer
- 12a. Mobile/touch screen keyboard interface (do not allow mobile system keyboard to be triggered, only the keyboard within system)
- 12b. When in desktop mode or keyboard is present, this is the terminal section
- 12c. Keyboard leaves when keyboard peripheral is present.
