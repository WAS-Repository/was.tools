# World Archive System Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the World Archive System (WAS) project. This section contains architectural plans, technical specifications, and implementation details for building a decentralized knowledge preservation system.

## Architecture Overview

The World Archive System is built using a micro-services architecture across multiple specialized domains:

- [Architecture Overview](architecture/00_architecture_overview.md) - High-level system design and domain structure
- [Ingestion Mesh](architecture/01_ingestion_mesh.md) - Data harvesting and processing pipeline
- [Storage Core](architecture/02_storage_core.md) - IPFS cluster and data persistence layer
- [Search Stack](architecture/03_search_stack.md) - Indexing and retrieval systems
- [Frontend Studio](architecture/04_frontend_studio.md) - User interface and interactive workbench
- [Ops & Observability](architecture/05_ops_observability.md) - Monitoring, logging, and operational infrastructure

## Beta Program

We're planning to launch beta access to the World Archive System in phases. If you're interested in participating in our upcoming beta program, please check back for more information.
